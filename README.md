# LazyCloud

This repo is specifically designed for Terraform and all it's associated files & Terraform Manifests

In this repo all the credentials are stored as a environment variable
Here, I am using KSH as a environment in Fedora Linux but in most cases it's a bash environment.
So to use environment variable export the below environment variables i.e. in BASH env edit the .bashrc file

AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"
AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""

**Note:** No use of material should be done without proper consent.

Thanks,
